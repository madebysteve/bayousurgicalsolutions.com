This is where your expensive, high-end medical and surgical disposables could end up if they expire, losing you tens of thousands of dollars that could be put back into your supply chain.

> Hospitals that provide surgery are wasting billions of dollars annually due to expired surgical disposable products.

Our experience at Bayou is that most domestic surgical facilities do a thorough job at identifying moving inventory. Where the problem lies is in the disposition process—mainly the time and labor constraints involved.

Look no further! Bayou Surgical Solutions will handle all of your concerns in the disposition process at no cost!
