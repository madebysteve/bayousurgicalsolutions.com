This is where your expensive, high-end medical and surgical disposables could end up if they expire, losing you tens of thousands of dollars that could be put back into your supply chain.

> Hospitals that provide surgery are wasting billions of dollars annually due to expired surgical disposable products.

Our experience at Bayou is that most domestic surgical facilities do a thorough job at identifying moving inventory. Where the problem lies is in the disposition processâ€”mainly the time and labor constaraints involved.

Look no further! Bayou Surgical Solutions will handle all of your concerns in the disposition process at no cost!
